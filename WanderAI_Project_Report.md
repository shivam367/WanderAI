## üìå Data Flow & Backend (Client-Side Focus)

WanderAI primarily operates on the client-side for its core AI interactions and data storage in this version.

### ü§ñ AI Model Integration:

*   **Core AI Engine**: Genkit framework (`genkit` and `@genkit-ai/next`).
*   **Language Models**: Google Gemini models accessed via the `@genkit-ai/googleai` plugin. The default model is specified in `src/ai/genkit.ts` (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`).
*   **Capabilities Utilized**:
    *   **Text Generation**: Used for creating detailed itineraries, refining existing plans based on feedback, suggesting interests, and powering chatbot responses.
    *   **Structured Data Output**: AI models are prompted to return data that can be parsed or directly used (e.g., Zod schemas define input/output for flows).
*   **AI Flows Defined (`src/ai/flows/`)**:
    *   `generate-itinerary.ts`: Takes user preferences (destination, interests, currency, budget, duration) to generate a full travel plan.
    *   `refine-itinerary.ts`: Accepts an existing itinerary and user feedback to produce a modified version.
    *   `suggest-interests-flow.ts`: Dynamically suggests travel interests based on user input in the form.
    *   `itinerary-chat-flow.ts`: Manages the conversational AI, taking itinerary context, chat history, and user messages to provide travel-related assistance.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Services:

*   **Google AI Platform**: Utilized via Genkit for accessing Gemini models. Requires a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` configured in the environment.

### üîí User Data Management:

All user-specific data in the current version of WanderAI is stored in the **user's browser via `localStorage`**.

*   **User Accounts**: User profiles (name, email, and a simple representation of password for this demo) are stored in a list within `localStorage`.
*   **Itineraries**: Generated and refined itineraries are stored in `localStorage`, keyed by the user's email, allowing each user to have their own history.
*   **Chat History**: Conversations with the AI chatbot are stored in `localStorage`, associated with a specific user and itinerary ID.
*   **Theme Preference**: The selected UI theme (light/dark/system) is stored in `localStorage`.
*   **Data Scope**: Data is local to the browser it was created in. There is no central server-side database for persistent storage of user accounts or itineraries beyond `localStorage`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è UI Components & Design Patterns (ShadCN UI & Custom Components)

WanderAI leverages the ShadCN UI component library, built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, for a consistent and accessible user interface.

### üß© Key UI Components Used:

*   **Layout & Navigation**:
    *   `Header`, `Footer` (custom layout components).
    *   `Sheet`: For the AI chatbot interface.
    *   `Link` (from `next/link`): For client-side navigation.
    *   `DropdownMenu`: For theme selection and potentially other actions.
*   **Content Display**:
    *   `Card`: Extensively used for forms, itinerary display sections, profile sections, history items.
    *   `Accordion`: For collapsible sections within the itinerary display (e.g., day-by-day plans).
    *   `ScrollArea`: For scrollable content regions like itinerary display and chat.
    *   `Avatar`: For user/bot representation in chat.
    *   `Image` (from `next/image`): For static images (e.g., on the homepage).
*   **Forms & Input**:
    *   `Form` (from `react-hook-form` via ShadCN).
    *   `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`, `Button`.
*   **Interaction & Feedback**:
    *   `AlertDialog`: For confirmations (e.g., delete actions, clear history).
    *   `Toast` (via `useToast` hook): For non-intrusive notifications.
    *   `LoadingSpinner` (custom): To indicate processing states.
    *   `Tooltip`: For providing additional information on hover.
*   **Structure & Styling**:
    *   `Separator`: For visual division of content.
    *   `cn` utility: For conditional class name merging.
    *   Tailwind CSS: For all styling and responsive design.

### üé® Theming:

*   **Dark/Light/System Mode**: Managed by the `ThemeToggle` component (`src/components/layout/theme-toggle.tsx`), which adds/removes a `.dark` class on the `<html>` element and uses `localStorage` for persistence.
*   **CSS Variables**: Theme colors (primary, accent, background, foreground, etc.) are defined as CSS HSL variables in `src/app/globals.css` for both light and dark modes. These variables are used by ShadCN components and custom styles.
*   **Responsive Design**: Achieved primarily through Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) and flex/grid layouts to ensure usability across different screen sizes.
